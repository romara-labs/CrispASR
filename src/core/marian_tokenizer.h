// src/core/marian_tokenizer.h — MarianMT / Opus-MT tokenizer (header-only).
//
// What Hugging Face's MarianTokenizer does for the source side, reproduced
// stage by stage so the ids are the reference's ids and not "close":
//
//   1. an optional leading `>>xxx<<` target-language code is cut off and
//      looked up as ONE vocabulary token (multi-target checkpoints);
//   2. the rest goes through the SOURCE SentencePiece model:
//        a. the normalizer — the model's precompiled charsmap (nmt_nfkc: a
//           Darts double-array trie, longest match), then whitespace
//           handling (strip, collapse, dummy prefix, space → U+2581);
//        b. unigram Viterbi, as SentencePiece's EncodeOptimized does it:
//           scores summed in double, compared against the float already
//           stored, an <unk> edge offered only where no one-character piece
//           exists, at min_score - 10;
//        c. consecutive unknowns merged into one piece whose text is the
//           merged surface;
//   3. each PIECE STRING is looked up in vocab.json. Marian's vocabulary is not
//      the SentencePiece id space: a piece the SP model knows but vocab.json
//      does not (`▁peoples` in opus-mt-en-de) is <unk>, and an unknown surface
//      that happens to be in vocab.json is that token;
//   4. </s> is appended.
//
// The pieces of step 2 and the ids of step 3 are therefore two different
// tables, and a converter that stores only one of them cannot be faithful.
//
// Not reproduced: Hugging Face splits the literal strings "</s>", "<unk>" and
// "<pad>" out of the input before step 1 and maps them to their ids. Here they
// are ordinary text.
//
// Decoding (HF `decode(skip_special_tokens=True)`): drop </s> / <unk> / <pad>,
// concatenate the pieces, U+2581 → space, strip.
