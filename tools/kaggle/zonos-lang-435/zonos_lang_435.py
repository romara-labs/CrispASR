"""#435: prove the zonos non-English fix end-to-end, on a box that has the model.

The fix (1f9e62c3) has three parts and only one of them is verified so far:
  a) in-process libespeak-ng before the popen fallback
  b) raw-character tokenisation restricted to pure ASCII; non-ASCII with no
     phonemizer is a LOUD refusal instead of ~0.9 s of confident noise
  c) per-request language actually reaches the model

(b)'s predicate was unit-tested locally. (a) and (c) need the model, which is
~1.6 GB + a DAC codec — over this project's "no large models on the VPS" line.

ARMS, and each is designed so a pass cannot be mistaken for a skip:

  1. russian_with_espeak   espeak-ng installed, -l ru. Expect real audio whose
     ASR transcript contains Cyrillic. THE BUG WAS: 3 phoneme tokens and noise.
  2. russian_no_espeak     espeak-ng removed from PATH and libespeak hidden.
     Expect a NON-ZERO exit and the refusal message — NOT a WAV. Pre-fix this
     produced a valid-looking 0.9 s file of garbage at a success code, which is
     the whole point of the issue.
  3. english_no_espeak     same hostile environment, ASCII text. Expect SUCCESS:
     ASCII still takes the raw-tokenisation path. This is the control that stops
     arm 2 from passing for the trivial reason "the binary refuses everything".
  4. language_applied      ONE `crispasr --server` process started with -l en,
     then two POST /v1/audio/speech requests carrying "language":"ru" and
     "language":"en". Requires the backend's own "phoneme tokens (lang=XX)" line
     to track the REQUEST. This is the only arm that can see the second half of
     the bug: a long-lived server applied its startup language to every request.

Arm 3 is the one that makes arms 1 and 2 mean anything. Without it, a binary
that simply failed on all input would score a clean pass. Arm 4 had the same
disease in v1 of this script -- it used two separate CLI processes, so each one
set its language at INIT, a path that was never broken. It would have passed on
the unfixed build. Two processes cannot test what only one process can exhibit.
