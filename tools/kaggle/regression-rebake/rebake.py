"""Bake the missing regression reference dumps ($KAGGLE_ACCOUNT).

38 of the 45 entries in tests/regression/manifest.json are `skip_diff: true` —
transcript-only, because their ref dump was never produced. A transcript check
catches a backend that breaks loudly; it cannot catch a stage that drifts. This
runs the canonical suite in rebake mode so those entries can become full
stage-by-stage cosine diffs.

WHY A WRAPPER. `kaggle kernels push` uploads ONLY `code_file` (kaggle_usage.md,
"What gets uploaded" — proven by a ModuleNotFoundError, not inferred), so the
800-line canonical script cannot be shipped as a bundled sibling. It is fetched
from the repo at runtime, which is also how the C++ under test arrives.

The canonical script is driven entirely by environment variables and defaults to
MODE=validate; a kernel push cannot set env vars, so they are set here before it
is executed. That is the whole reason this file exists.
