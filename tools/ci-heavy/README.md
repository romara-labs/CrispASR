# tools/ci-heavy: heavy CPU jobs on GitHub Actions

Scripts here run on GitHub-hosted runners through `.github/workflows/heavy-cpu.yml`,
triggered by hand. Use this for CPU work that used to go to Kaggle: Python reference
dumps, parity diffs, ASR roundtrips, and download → convert → quantize → upload.

| Runner | CPU / RAM | Disk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ubuntu-latest` (default) | 4 vCPU / 16 GB | ~14 GB free on `/`, plus the `/mnt` scratch disk; the workflow also deletes unused toolchains | fp32 references up to ~3B params |
| `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | 4 vCPU / 16 GB | as above, minus `/mnt` | aarch64 numerics |
| `macos-14` | 3 vCPU (M1) / 7 GB | ~14 GB | Metal |

Runners are free for public repos and a job can run up to 6 h.

**Keep on Kaggle** (`tools/kaggle/`) only what needs a real GPU: CUDA or Vulkan
speed and parity on hardware, and PyTorch on CUDA. Kaggle allows one account per
person, with GPU sessions used for GPU work.

## Running a job

```bash
gh workflow run heavy-cpu.yml -f script=tools/ci-heavy/<name>.py \
    -f pip="torch torchvision transformers>=4.57 accelerate pillow"
gh run watch "$(gh run list -w heavy-cpu.yml -L 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')"
gh run download <run-id>           # the $HEAVY_OUT artifact
```

## Script contract

- **`$HEAVY_OUT`**: write results here. The whole directory becomes the run's artifact, kept for 14 days.
- **`$HEAVY_SCRATCH`**: large scratch space for models, builds and caches. Not uploaded. `HF_HOME` points inside it.
- **`$HF_TOKEN`**: the repository secret (fine-grained, CI-scoped); may be empty.
- **`$HEAVY_OUT/summary.md`**: if present, appended to the run's summary page.
- **Exit code**: non-zero when the check fails, so the run shows red. A readout that prints the same thing whether it passed or failed isn't a check.
- **Paths**: the workflow only accepts `.py` / `.sh` files under `tools/ci-heavy/`.
- **Porting a Kaggle kernel**: replace `/kaggle/working` with `$HEAVY_OUT` and `/kaggle/input/...` with a download into `$HEAVY_SCRATCH`. Drop the GPU and ccache datasets.

`miotts_sample_rate.py` checks the pinned MioCodec-v2 model through the native
live test, session rate getter, CLI WAV header and both TTS→ASR roundtrips.
It also checks 24 kHz and missing-key metadata dispatch using temporary copies;
those copies are not claimed to be legacy codec speech models. Run with
`-f pip="numpy gguf huggingface_hub"` on Linux x86 or ARM.
